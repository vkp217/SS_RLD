# Single-snapshot acqusition for Fluorescenec Lifetime Estimation
## Overview
Using novel Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) named SwissSPAD3 or SS3 developed by AQUA group, EPFL (Prof. Edoardo Charbon) it is possible to estimate the fluorscence lifetime estimation without tedious time-resolved data acqusiition.
This work has generated the computation method with SS3 with dual channel photon acquisition mechanism to estimation Flurosecence Lifeitme Estimation using single acquisition
This work has also demonstated the use of Deep Learning model to compendate the artifacts generated by single acquisition method in comparison to time-resolved data acquisition method.

## Set-up
## Usage
the code can be used directly using
python src/ss/main.py
